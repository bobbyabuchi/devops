In Kubernetes, simplify the lifecycle management of containerized applications by:
- restarting of unresponsive pods
- application rollour strategies

In lifecycle management in Kubernetes,
- Developers declare the application state in a resource manifest. Kubernetes ensures the application state is identical to the declared state. 
- - This is the declarative approach.
